what happens when spring boot starts up
did you work in any messaging services

Rahul Taneja
1.Time complexity for ArrayList,Linkedlist,Hashset, Treemap, concurrenthashmap
2.In Set, how to store elements in insertion order?
3.Lifecycle of thread
4.what is immutable class. Write an immutable class
5.write a code for deadlock scenario
1. Explain project architecture
2. Write custom class that creates fixed thread pool ..(ans - create class and will have constructor getThread methods etc)
3. If class has 4 method A and B are dependent and C & D are dependent then how will you handle the thread safely- answer add locking using synchronised
4. SQL - if student and subject tables are there with M to M relationship then how will you create tables
5. Follow up question if I want all the subject to fetch using student name write query
6. Follow up question if no subject is assigned the print site r name and return null for the subject write query
7. Internal working of concurrent HashMap

{  
    public void baseMethod()  
    {  
        System.out.println("BaseMethod called ...");  
    }  
}
